		--- digup - A Digest Updating Tool ---

Description

digup is a tool to update md5sum or shasum digest files. It will read
these digest files, check the current directory for new, updated,
modified or deleted files and query the user with a summary of
changes.

One of the envisioned applications of digup is updating and
verification of incremental archives or music collections. By using
digup possibly undesired changes or lost files can be easily detected
while quickly adding newly added files.

Another purpose could be to automatically verify the integrity of hard
disk copies of archives as backups to hard disks are becoming
popular. Using a full file digest scan even slowly creeping bad blocks
on old hard disks can be detected. By using a crontab entry, this
check could be performed unattended and routinely.

In normal operation, only touched files with newer modification times
are fully read and their digest compared. Optionally a full scan can
be performed to test all file contents to the expected digests.

Symbolic links are supported by either following the link and reading
the targetâ€™s digest or by saving only the link target path and
verifying it against the old one.

The digest files written by digup are compatible with those generated
and read by md5sum and similar programs from the coreutils
package. Additional information like file size and modification time
or symlinks are stored on comment lines.

Four digest algorithms are supported: MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and
SHA512. The digest file itself is also checksumed using CRC32 against
unintentional changes. A fast red-black binary tree is used for the
file list.
